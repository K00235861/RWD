		<h2>Meerkats â€“ As cute as they look?</h2>
		<h3>By David Pilot 15/11/2019</h3>
		<nav class="articleBody">	
		<p id="summary"><strong>This photo of a pair of meerkats
		seems to suggest that meerkats are cute and playful animals,
		and a great choice for pets. But is this really the case?</strong></p>
		
		<p id="main text">Meerkats are mammals that mostly live in areas of South Africa, 
		and can be occasionally found in zoos around the globe. They are small creatures, 
		usually around 40 cm in length with a short tail of around 25 cm. They are mostly
		known for their upright posture when looking out for predators and other dangers.
		They are burrowing animals and they construct their dwellings underground,
		where up to 30 meerkats can live together.
		They are very sociable animals and look out for each other.
		However, does this make them a good choice for a pet?</p>
		<p id="main text"> Unfortunately, meerkats are not well suited for being kept as 
		pets for many reasons. Firstly, their diet consists of mainly insects and sometimes 
		small animals like lizards, snakes and scorpions. Secondly, they are expert diggers, 
		and so you may find your back garden (and most likely your mothers precious flower garden)
		ruined with many holes and mounds. Thirdly, and by far most importantly, 
		they are wild animals. They scent-mark their owners and the place they live in.
		They are known to be aggressive to guests and other animals in their territory.</p>
		<p id="main text"> All things considered, I would not recommend to have a meerkat as a pet.
		These small little mammals may look sweet, but they require a lot of training and patients
		to be even remotely suitable for being pets.</p>
