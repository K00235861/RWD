		<h2>Butterfly Designs</h2>

		<p id="summary"><strong>Butterfly wings are know for their beautiful designs. 
		But is there something more to it than just good looks?</strong></p>
		
		<p id="main text">Butterflies are insects that are present all around the world. 
		These beautiful insects come along way from caterpillars. Once they get to this 
		stage of their rather short lifespan, they need some kind of protection against 
		their natural predators which include wasps, flies, small birds and other insects. 
		They have a couple of defence mechanisms to avoid an early death. The most noticeable 
		one being the colour and patterns of their wings.</p>
		<p id="main text"> Some butterflies use their wing colour and patterns as a form of camouflage.
		The oakleaf and autumn leaf butterfly have their wings look like leaves to blend in better 
		with their surroundings. Many butterflies have eyespots on their wings, which can serve as 
		defence, confusing an opponent tricking them to believe that they are looking at a much 
		larger creature, or as a way to attract partners. Sometimes butterflies have exotic, bright 
		colours on their wings, which signify something poisonous in nature, which also applies to 
		many butterflies feeding on poisonous plants and gaining the poison as a defence. The next 
		time you see a unique looking butterfly, now you will know that those colours and patterns 
		are not just for show. </p>
