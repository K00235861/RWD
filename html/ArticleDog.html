		<h2>Dogs vs Wolves</h2>
		<h3>By Dave Potato Pilot 1/11/2019</h3>
		<nav class="articleBody">	
		<p id="summary"><strong>Ever look at a dog and think “How different are dogs and wolves?” 
		No? Well, this article will answer that question anyway!</strong></p>
		
		<p id="main text">Even though dogs and wolves are genetically similar, 
		there are many differences to be found between man’s best friend and a fearsome wolf.
		Interestingly enough, a dogs head and brain are 20% and 30% smaller respectively 
		compared to a similar sized wolf. Dogs have a distinctive “stop” between forehead 
		and nose compared to wolves. A wolves bite is much more powerful compared to a dogs. 
		This is because the muscles used to close the jaw, the temporalis muscle, is much stronger
		on a wolf. Additionally, wolfs do not have a dewclaw on their back legs, which is a small
		distal part (almost like a finger or toe) of a many animal limbs. A wolfs paw is on average
		twice as big as a dogs and have amber or light coloured eyes compared to the usual brown dog
		eyes. Another difference is that a dogs tail tends to curl upwards, something that is not 
		found on wolves.</p>
		<p id="main text"> These changes happened over tens of thousands of years. 
		So the next time you have a look at a dog, you can think about how much they have 
		changed from their wolf ancestors.</p>
