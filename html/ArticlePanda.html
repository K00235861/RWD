		<h2>Are Pandas still in danger?</h2>
		<h3>By David Pilot 17/10/2019</h3>

		<p id="summary"><strong>The giant panda is a well-known animal by many people.
		With the panda population slowly rising, are pandas still in danger of becoming extinct?</strong></p>
		
		<p id="main text">The giant panda is part of the bear or ursine family of animals.
		Its natural habitat are the bamboo forests in China in which there is plenty of 
		food for the pandas, bamboo. It makes up almost 99% of the pandas diet, 
		which makes the panda a very inflexible animal when it comes to choosing a place to live. 
		This very factor is the main reason of the panda being a threatened animal 
		when it comes to extinction. Deforestation of the bamboo forests in China to make 
		more space for people to live has forced the panda population to move, and also has 
		significantly reduced the amount of bamboo available for consumption by pandas. 
		Another factor worth considering is the very low birth rates of pandas. Even so, 
		panda populations are steadily increasing.</p>
		<p id="main text"> This is due to the efforts of zoos and animal preservation 
		organisations in China and also worldwide. Laws In China have been slowly but 
		steadily introduced to protect pandas, which includes a ban on poaching and the 
		removal of human settlements from dedicated panda reservation areas. This and many 
		other factors have helped the panda population to slowly recover. In 2006, 
		it was reported that the panda population was at roughly 3000 in the wild. 
		In 2016, the giant panda had officially became a threatened species, a safer status 
		endangered, which points to the conservation methods being successful. But still far from safe.</p>
		<p id="main text"> In short, if the preservation methods continue to be successful, the population of the panda will rise to safe levels.</p>
